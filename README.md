# Flash Memory Reader with ESP32

This ESP32 project demonstrates how to read the entire memory content of a flash chip in chunks using SPI communication. It includes functions to read the flash chip ID and to print memory contents in a readable format.

## Features
- Reads and displays the flash chip ID.
- Reads flash memory in configurable chunks.
- Outputs data to the Serial Monitor.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- SPI Flash Chip (compatible with standard SPI protocol)
- Jumper wires

I used   MX25L4005APC-12G is an 8-pin SPI NOR flash memory chip. 

Here's the pinout mapping for the MX25L4005APC-12G 8-pin DIP package and its corresponding connections to the ESP32 based on the provided project:

``` 
| Pin on MX25L4005APC-12G | Name      | Description                    | ESP32 Connection  |
|--------------------------|--------- |--------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1                        | CS#      | Chip Select (Active Low)       | GPIO 5            |
| 2                        | DO (MISO)| Data Out (Master In Slave Out) | GPIO 19           |
| 3                        | WP#      | Write Protect (Active Low)     | Connect to 3.3V   |
| 4                        | GND      | Ground                         | GND               |

| 7                        | HOLD#    | Hold (Active Low)              | Connect to 3.3V   |
| 8                        | VCC      | Power Supply (2.7â€“3.6V)        | 3.3V              |
``` 
### Notes:
1. **CS# (Chip Select)**: Active low signal used to enable the chip for SPI communication. Connect this to `GPIO 5` on the ESP32, as specified in the code.
2. **DO (MISO)**: Data sent from the flash chip to the ESP32 during read operations. Connect to `GPIO 19` on the ESP32.
3. **DI (MOSI)**: Data sent from the ESP32 to the flash chip during write operations. Connect to `GPIO 23` on the ESP32.
4. **CLK (Serial Clock)**: Synchronizes the communication between the ESP32 and the flash chip. Connect to `GPIO 18` on the ESP32.
5. **WP# (Write Protect)**: This pin disables writing when active (low). Tie it to 3.3V if write protection is not needed.
6. **HOLD#**: Temporarily pauses SPI communication when active (low). Tie it to 3.3V if not used.
7. **VCC**: Provide 3.3V power to the chip.
8. **GND**: Connect to the ground of the ESP32.

### Schematic Example
```
ESP32        MX25L4005APC-12G
------       --------------
GPIO 5  -->  CS#
GPIO 18 -->  CLK
GPIO 19 -->  DO (MISO)
GPIO 23 -->  DI (MOSI)
3.3V    -->  VCC, WP#, HOLD#
GND     -->  GND
```

Ensure your flash chip operates at 3.3V to avoid damage, as the ESP32's GPIO pins are not 5V tolerant. Use level shifters if required for other configurations.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lahirunirmalx/spi-eeprom-tool.git
   ```
2. Open the ` src/main.cpp` file in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
3. Install the ESP32 board package:
   - In the Arduino IDE, go to **File > Preferences** and add the following URL in the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field: `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`.
   - Then, go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**, search for `ESP32`, and install the package.
4. Set the correct COM port and board in the IDE:
   - Select **Tools > Board > ESP32 Dev Module** (or your specific ESP32 board).
   - Choose the correct port under **Tools > Port**.
5. Upload the sketch to your ESP32.

## Usage
1. Wire your ESP32 to the flash chip as per the pinout table.
2. Power on the ESP32 and connect it to your computer.
3. Open the Serial Monitor at a baud rate of 115200.
4. View the flash chip ID and memory contents.

## Configuration
- **Chip Select Pin**: Ensure `CS_PIN` is correctly set in the code to match your wiring.
- **Flash Size**: Update `FLASH_SIZE` in the code to match your flash chip's memory capacity.
- **Chunk Size**: Modify `CHUNK_SIZE` for reading memory in smaller or larger chunks.

## Example Output
```

```

## Notes
- Ensure your flash chip operates at 3.3V to avoid damaging it or your ESP32.
- Double-check your wiring, especially for `CS`, `SCLK`, `MISO`, and `MOSI` connections.
